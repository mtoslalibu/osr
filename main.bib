abstract = {Root cause localization, the process of identifying the source of problems in a system using purely external observations, is a significant challenge in many large-scale systems. In this paper, we propose an abstract model that captures the common issues underlying root cause localization and hence provides the ability to leverage solutions across different systems.},

abstract = {False detection is a major issue in deploying and maintaining Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Traditionally, it is recommended to customize its signature database (DB) to reduce false detections. However, it requires quite deep knowledge and skills to appropriately customize the signature DB. Inappropriate customization causes the increase of false negatives as well as false positives. In this paper, we propose a visualization system of a NIDS log, named SnortView, which supports administrators in analyzing NIDS alerts much faster and much more easily. Instead of customizing the signature DB, we propose to utilize visualization to recognize not only each alert but also false detections. The system is based on a 2-D time diagram and alerts are shown as icons with different styles and colors. In addition, the system introduces some visualization techniques such as overlayed statistical information, source-destination matrix, and so on. The system was used to detect real attacks while recognizing some false detections.},

abstract = {Distributed tracing is a core component of cloud and datacenter systems, and provides visibility into their end-to-end runtime behavior. To reduce computational and storage overheads, most tracing frameworks do not keep all traces, but sample them uniformly at random. While effective at reducing overheads, uniform random sampling inevitably captures redundant, common-case execution traces, which are less useful for analysis and troubleshooting tasks. In this work we present Sifter, a general-purpose framework for biased trace sampling. Sifter captures qualitatively more diverse traces, by weighting sampling decisions towards edge-case code paths, infrequent request types, and anomalous events. Sifter does so by using the incoming stream of traces to build an unbiased low-dimensional model that approximates the system's common-case behavior. Sifter then biases sampling decisions towards traces that are poorly captured by this model. We have implemented Sifter, integrated it with several open-source tracing systems, and evaluate with traces from a range of open-source and production distributed systems. Our evaluation shows that Sifter effectively biases towards anomalous and outlier executions, is robust to noisy and heterogeneous traces, is efficient and scalable, and adapts to changes in workloads over time.},
